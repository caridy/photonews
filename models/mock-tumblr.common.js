Today, we\u2019ve added new features along with animated cinemagraphs that make Yahoo for <a href=\"http://bit.ly/123q51p\">iPhone and iPod touch</a>\u00a0an even better experience for discovering and reading content whether in the moment or saving for later. And it\u2019s designed for iOS 7.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span>For those of you in the U.S., we&#8217;re introducing the ability to save your favorite content for later. With \u201cMy Saves\u201d you can simply tap a button and come back later.\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019re on the go, there&#8217;s no better way to make sure all your important news, information or entertainment are waiting for you when you have the time. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/4f5d72c72d3c25ad9717cab70f828c90/tumblr_inline_mtcdapwByC1qhxx5s.gif\"/></p>\n\n<p><span>We&#8217;ve also added breaking news, to make sure we alert you immediately.\u00a0\u00a0You can follow the story as it develops from our breaking news blog as information updates in real-time from Yahoo editors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/2dd07e8f4558bdcafc0d629b81470b63/tumblr_inline_mtazwxHZRS1qhxx5s.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p><span>At Yahoo, we realize that it\u2019s not just the quality of the content\u00a0\u00a0that keeps you coming back, it\u2019s the experience. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve made changes to almost every view of the app to make it cleaner, faster and more engaging.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/f1adeb9ca89efec02ce9c70705ea049a/tumblr_inline_mtcdb7KFoj1qhxx5s.gif\"/></p>\n\n<p><span>You can switch categories quicker than ever, and you\u2019ll notice that the stream has been given a cleaner look to make it more readable. When you tap an article, you\u2019ll see that we try to include a beautiful, relevant photo with each story. Some of them even have cinemagraphs - very subtly animated photos that bring the story to life.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/17af1b9b9b37f513f3e4c352b579d055/tumblr_inline_mtc67eDPM21qhxx5s.gif\"/></p>\n\n<p><span>In the coming days, features like \u201cMy Saves\u201d will make their way to the desktop, so you\u2019ll be able to flag any content that you find on Yahoo for later reading. That means that if you save something while you\u2019re on your computer, you can read it on your phone later.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span>We hope you enjoy the new Yahoo experience, it gets smarter every time you use it.</span></p>",
